WHAT IS IT?:
--------------------------------------------------------
This mod adds small portraits to speaking NPCs in IWDEE.  The big world of Icewind Dale gets even more beautiful! 
The goal of this mod is to add small portraits to every speaking NPC in the game.  

If any of the portraits are not to your satisfaction due to quality or you feel that the portrait does not
match the in game NPC, report that as well for potential inclusion in future updates.  You will have to 
start a new game to get the portraits on NPCs you've already met in game although future NPCs should have their
portraits.  This mod patches 154 creatures future updates from Beamdog may require reinstallation of the mod if
it modifies any of those characters.  Basically, if there is an update to the game, it's probably a good idea to 
uninstall and reinstall this mod.

Sources of the pictures include Neverwinter Nights portraits found online, searches for baldur's gate and IWD portraits,
The Super Ultimate Portrait Pack (http://www.moddb.com/games/baldurs-gate-enhanced-edition/addons/super-ultimate-portrait-pack),
 as a last resort I used search engines to round out the collection.   If there are any particular portraits 
that need to be removed you don't wish them to be featured in this work, let me know and the pictures will be removed.   

This mod is distributed freely and not for any commercial purpose non-profit.  This mod was not developed, supported, 
or endorsed by BioWare, Interplay/Black Isle, Beamdog or any other official agency. Portraits remain the copyright of 
their respective rights holders.  

If there are any copyright issues or this statement needs revision then please contact me to let me know what to do 
about it.  The purpose of this mod is not to make money but to advances knowledge and progress of the arts through 
the addition of something new onto a great game. 

Special thanks to bob_veng on the baldur's gate.com forums for recoloring, adjusting, selecting and creating new portraits 
for this mod.  It's as much his baby as it is mine now.

Thank you all and enjoy,
Smeagol
